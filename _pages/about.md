Hi there this is Hoyin. I am a computational biologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and I work closely with my advisors [Saud AlDubayan](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/saud-h-aldubayan-md/) and [Elizer Van Allen](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/). Previously I have also worked with [Predrag Radivojac](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/radivojac/) and I can't thank him enough for introducing me to the world of research. My overall interest is in precision health, in particular how to incorporate an invidual's genetic information into clinical management. Currently my research focuses on understanding the genetic architecture of breast cancer in understudied populations using machine learning approaches, and translating biological findings into clinical actions. You can find some of my work in the [Publications](/publications/) page or on my [CV](/cv/).

Computational biology is a passion of mine because it allows me to balance between innovation, discovery, and real-life impact. Having majored in computer science and mathematics, I am very interested in developing machine learning methods, but nothing excites me more than being able to apply them to answer biological questions, and using the knowledge gained to make changes in patients' lives. I am always open to collaborations so if any projects I have worked on or am working on sounds interesting to you, please don't hesitate to reach out! I am also going to be applying to Ph.D programs this coming fall (2022) so if there is any program where you think I will be a good fit please let me know! Thanks for reading! 

\- Hoyin
