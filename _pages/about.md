Hi there this is Hoyin. I am a computational biologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and I work closely with my advisors [Saud AlDubayan](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/saud-h-aldubayan-md/) and [Elizer Van Allen](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/). Previously I have also worked with [Predrag Radivojac](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/radivojac/) and I can't thank him enough for introducing me to the world of research. My overall interest is in precision health and my current research focuses on understanding the genetic architecutre of breast cancer in understudied populations using machine learning approaches and translating the findings into clinical actions.

Computational biology is a passion of mine because it allows me to balance between innovation, discovery, and real-life impact. Having majored in computer science and mathematics, I am very interested in developing machine learning methods, but nothing excites me more than being able to apply them to answer biological questions, and using the knowledge gained to make changes in patients' lives. For example, in the nuMOM2b project, through association rules we were able to identify a non-linear relationship between exercise and a type-2 diabetes polygenic risk score, which may carry clinical signficance to those who are genetic predisposed to gestational diabetes. For more information, please check out the publication page and stay tuned for more!

I am always open to collaborations so if any projects I have worked on / am working on sounds interesting to you, please don't hesitate to reach out! I am also going to be applying to Ph.D programs this coming fall (2022) so if there is any program where you think I will be a good fit please let me know! Thanks for reading! 

\- Hoyin
