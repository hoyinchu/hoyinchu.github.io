Hi there this is Hoyin. I am currently a first-year student in the Tri-Instituional Ph.D. program in Computational Biology and Medicine. Previously, I was a computational biologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and I work closely with my advisors [Saud AlDubayan](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/saud-h-aldubayan-md/) and [Eliezer Van Allen](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/). I have also worked with [Predrag Radivojac](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/radivojac/) at Northeastern University and I can't thank him enough for introducing me to the world of research. My overall interest is in the understanding of cancer biology throught computational approaches, including but not limited to biomarker discovery through large-scale biobanks, the somatic evolution of cancer-inducing mutations, and the translation of these findings into equitable clinical applications. You can find some of my work in the [Publications](/publications/) page, [Abstracts](/abstracts/), or on my [CV](/cv/).

Computational biology is a passion of mine because it allows me to innovate, discover, and make real-life impacts to patients' lives. I am always open to collaborations so if any projects I have worked on or am working on sounds interesting to you, please don't hesitate to reach out! Thanks for reading! 

\- Hoyin
