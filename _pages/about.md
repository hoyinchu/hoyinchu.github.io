Hi there this is Hoyin. I am a first-year Ph.D student in the [Tri-Instituional Ph.D. program in Computational Biology and Medicine](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/). My research interest is in understanding how a person's genetic background can affect cancer development and treatment responses, as well as using computational approaches to design and develop cancer therapies. You can find some of my work in the [Publications](/publications/) page, [Abstracts](/abstracts/), or on my [CV](/cv/).

Currently I am a graduate student working closely with Caleb in the [Lareau Lab](https://clareaulab.com/members/caleb-lareau.html) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Previously, I was a computational biologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute working with [Saud AlDubayan](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/saud-h-aldubayan-md/) and [Eliezer Van Allen](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/). I also worked as a research assistant with [Predrag Radivojac](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/radivojac/) during my time at Northeastern University.

Computational biology is a passion of mine because it allows me to innovate, discover, and make real-life impacts to improve patient lives. I am always open to collaborations so if any projects I have worked on or am working on sounds interesting to you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email or twitter! Thanks for reading! 

\- Hoyin
